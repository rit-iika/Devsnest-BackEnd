/* 
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

1.Execute any code.
2.Make changes to the request and the response objects.
3.End the request-response cycle.
4.Call the next middleware function in the stack.
